# Hackathon from University of Padua: Ecommerce Data Analysis
In this hackathon we had a dataset from an ecommerce. We had some question to answered and some analysis to do.
The original file was in Italian and I translate all in English, so if there are some grammatical mistake it's for that (ðŸ˜‚).
My solution wa one of the best so I hope that this file can help you to improve you statistics/data scientist/coding skills.
